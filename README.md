## Data
[Human Activity Recognition dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]

## Files
1. CodeBook.md which contains the stepwise guide through the code and any modifications performed on the data. Futhermore it has information about the different datasets obtained and the used variables (features).

2. run_analysis.R which contains the script that is able to perform the following steps:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. Tidy_set_PatrickKoldenhof.txt which contains the final output that is obtained from the script run_analysis.R.
